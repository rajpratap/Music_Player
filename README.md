## Requirements

As this is a graphical application you need to install the graphical module(tkinter) for this,
and another module you need to install is (eyed3), and most important one is (pygame) which is actually playing the role of backend processes.
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install tkinter, eyed3 and pygame.

```bash
pip install tkinter
pip install eyed3
pip install pygame
```

Run these command on cmd to install the required modules.
